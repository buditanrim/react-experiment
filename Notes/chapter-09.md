# Optimizing

## Single responsibility principles

- Each component should only have one job/responsibility
- For example, RestaurantMenu = display the restaurant menu
- RestaurantCard = we got the props and show the data in the card
- Single responsibility -> Maintainable
- Single responsibility -> Reusable
- Single responsibility -> Testable

## Custom Hooks

- What is hook? A JS utility function
- So far, we use Hooks like `useState` `useParam` `useEffect` from React
- Custom hooks help us to abstracting some logic and keep each component single responsible
